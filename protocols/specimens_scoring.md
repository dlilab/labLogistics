# Digitized specimens scoring


1. Download the software `Imageant` here: https://gitlab.com/stuckyb/imageant  In the README file, there are links to the executable tools for Windows and MacOS.
2. I have attached the script to be use with Imageant.
3. Here are the images (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2nfxkzup4d7oyw8/AADLOTv0KylqsKqVX5Rz269aa/images_2022-10-05?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1). Let's do `images_1_2022_10_05.zip` first. You can download it and unzip it to your local folder. It is 5.5 Gb, so may take a while to download.
4. Open Imageant, then click 'file` --> 'New annotation session', choose where do you want to save the session, the path of the script, and the path to the image folder.
5. Then on the top right, it will ask you a set of questions and the corresponding key press for answers. Follow the instructions there. `Ctrl + z` to undo last step.
   - Try to zoom in to see the details because sometimes, flowers and fruits are tiny and hard to see.
6. Imageant will switch to next image automatically once the current image was scored.
7. You can save it without finishing the whole set of images; later you can pick up from where you left. If the app was closed accidentally, the results should have been saved automatically too.



## Some  notes

- Some species, especially grasses, are extremely difficult to tell flowers from fruits; we may want to consider some label such as "reproductive structure presence/absence"
- Some specimens do not have flowers/fruits, but the labels mentioned something like "fruit yellow", probably as general descriptions instead of indicating actual fruits presence. Similar for flowers for some specimens
